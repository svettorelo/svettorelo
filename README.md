### Hi! I'm Sabrina Vettorelo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working on a group project developing a web application for online professional services assistance, you can see a video here [ðŸ“½](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PL8y3GvoDubMhtGntabqjh35rXN3Wllu/view?usp=sharing) or try it for yourself here [ðŸ•¹](https://latam-exponential.netlify.app/).
- ðŸŒ± I recently graduate from a coding bootcamp at [Henry](https://www.soyhenry.com), so now I'm a Full Stack Developer and I keep learning.
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m looking for new challenges, expanding my programming skills, targeting web development. My goal is to use everything I have learned to solve problems wherever I might be, and keep on learning new things.

- ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts: I do not only code, my experience in life has taken me from working in a research group, performing electrochemical experiments and mathematical modeling of reaction processes, to teaching in the School of Engineering where I graduate as Biomedical Eng.
