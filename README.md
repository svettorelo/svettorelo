### Hi! I'm Sabrina Vettorelo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project developing a web application for online professional services assistance.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m about to finish a coding bootcamp at [Henry](https://www.soyhenry.com) to be a Full Stack Developer.
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m looking for new challenges, expanding my programming skills, targeting web development. My goal is to use everything I have learned to solve problems wherever I might be, and keep on learning new things.

- ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts: I do not only code, my experience in life has taken me from working in a research group, performing electrochemical experiments and mathematical modeling of reaction processes, to teaching in the School of Engineering where I graduate as Biomedical Eng.
